# Visualizing and Understanding Convolutional Networks

### Questions:

##### 1) Introduction

- Why do we even care about feature visualization?

##### 2.1)  Visualization with a Deconvnet

- How do we deal with "unpooling" a pooling layer, making a small image bigger?



- Why do we not use transpose convolution for upsampling the image instead of the max unpooling above?



##### 4) Covnet Visualization

- What do we visualize in the simplest, basic unit? Is it a layer, a feature map, a value of a feature map, ...?


- How come we generate both a activation and a image patch? Does the model generate these pictures? Are they training images?



- What changes do they propose to the original AlexNet and why?



- Discuss feature generalization in the context of this paper.
