# DL Papers

This repository follows a road map of Deep Learning papers, as followed by DATA's DL study group.

We read 1 or 2 papers every week, after completing Standfords CS 231n Deep Learning course. This course is considered a pre-requisite for understanding everything that follows in depth.

With every paper, we have a sample implementation and a list of questions associated with it - You can also view my personal answers to it.
